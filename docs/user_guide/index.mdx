# User Guide

Welcome to the ToolCraft User Guide. This comprehensive guide will help you understand and use all of ToolCraft's features effectively.

## What You'll Learn

This user guide covers:

- **[Command Line Interface](cli)**: Complete CLI reference and usage patterns
- **[Examples](examples)**: Practical examples and common use cases
- **Core Concepts**: Understanding ToolCraft's architecture and design principles

## Getting Started

If you haven't already, make sure you've completed the [Installation](../installation) and [Quick Start](../quickstart) guides.

## Core Concepts

### Design Philosophy

ToolCraft is built around several key principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Easy-to-use APIs and clear documentation
2. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and comprehensive testing
3. **Flexibility**: Extensible architecture for custom workflows
4. **Performance**: Efficient implementations for automation tasks

### Architecture Overview

ToolCraft consists of several core components:

- **Main Module** (`toolcraft.main`): Core functionality and utilities
- **CLI Module** (`toolcraft.cli`): Command-line interface and entry points
- **Version Module** (`toolcraft._version`): Version management

### Common Workflows

Here are some typical workflows when using ToolCraft:

1. **Development Automation**:
   - Use ToolCraft CLI for quick tasks
   - Integrate ToolCraft functions into your scripts
   - Build custom automation workflows

2. **Task Automation**:
   - Create reusable automation scripts
   - Schedule tasks using ToolCraft utilities
   - Monitor and log automation processes

3. **Cross-Platform Development**:
   - Use ToolCraft's cross-platform utilities
   - Build portable automation solutions
   - Handle platform-specific requirements

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

When using ToolCraft in your projects:

```python
# Import only what you need
from toolcraft.main import hello_message

# Use descriptive variable names
greeting_text = hello_message()

# Add error handling
try:
    result = hello_message()
    print(f"Success: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### CLI Usage

For command-line usage:

```bash
# Use long option names for scripts
toolcraft --hello --version

# Combine options efficiently
toolcraft --help | grep -i option
```

### Integration

When integrating ToolCraft into larger projects:

- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies
- Document your ToolCraft usage in your project's README
- Consider wrapping ToolCraft functions for your specific use cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Performance Issues**:
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks
- Use appropriate data structures for your use case
- Consider async operations for I/O-bound tasks
