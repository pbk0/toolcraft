## Build Tools ✅ COMPLETED

Based on `pyproject.toml` certain tools are directly available like `uv run black .` as it is registered in `pyproject.toml` as `[tool.black]`.

We can wrap the opensource tools in our `build_tools.py` or else call them by directly registering in `pyproject.toml`. 

Any complex or custom command we write in `build_tools.py` and call it like `uv run build_tools.py serve-docs`.

~~In future we should be able to configure `build_tools.py` in `pyproject.toml` like other opensource tools.~~

**✅ IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Added `build-tools` script entry point in `[project.scripts]`
- Created `[tool.build_tools]` configuration section in `pyproject.toml`
- Multiple access patterns now available:
  - `uv run build-tools <command>` (recommended)
  - `uv run build_tools.py <command>` (direct script)
  - `uv run <tool> <args>` (individual tools)
- Configuration is read from `pyproject.toml` and used for default values
